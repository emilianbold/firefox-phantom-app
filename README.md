# Public archive of Phantom.app for Firefox

This is a public history of the MIT licensed Phantom.app wallet release for Firefox on https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/phantom-app/versions/ by Phantom Technologies, Inc.

The current repository is not controlled by Phantom Technologies, Inc. and makes no copyright claims, it just mirrors the Firefox releases as a git repository.

Each Phantom version upto 22.7.25 has been released by the Phantom Technologies, Inc. as MIT licensed on https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/phantom-app/versions/

Sadly, each release is also minified. Until the original authors make a proper open source release, this will do.
